               <h2>Volley-ball</h2>

    <p>

      I play volley-ball for four years now and it became my favorite sport immediatly. Volley-ball teachs you values such as team spirit, self-improvement and rigor. This sport helped me in every aspect of my life, even in my scholarship: you learn to work with a team which is really helpfull for my studies in IESEG or even in my future professional life. More than a sport, volley-ball is a therapy.

               <h2>Piano</h2>

    <p>

             I am a huge fan of piano. I don't really play anymore, even if sometimes it's always pleasant to sit in front of it and play the few songs i still remember. I use to play for five years between 7 years-old and 12 years old but I stopped because I thought it was boring. I regret it today because it's a wonderfull instrument and everytime I listen to some amazing pieces, I wish I could play it

               <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>

               With volley-ball and piano, my others favorite hobbies are travels, go to the gym and hang out with my friends at the bar. Firstly, travels, I visited a lot of countries and it's always been a peasure to discover new cultures, new people and to see diverses landscapes. Then there is the gym: to me it's the best activity to empty your brain of all the stress of the day or the week. Finally, hanging out with my friends has always been one of my favorite thing to do.
